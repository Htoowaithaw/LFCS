The /bin directory is very important because:

It contains executable programs and scripts needed by both system administrators and unprivileged users, which are required when no other filesystems have yet been mounted; for example, when booting into single user or recovery mode.
It may also contain executables which are used indirectly by scripts.
It may not include any subdirectories.
Required programs which must exist in the /bin/ directory include:

cat, chgrp, chmod, chown, cp, date, dd, df, dmesg, echo, false, hostname, kill, ln, login, ls, mkdir, mknod, more, mount, mv, ps, pwd, rm, rmdir, sed, sh, stty, su, sync, true, umount and uname

[ and test may be there as well, and optionally, it may include: csh, ed, tar, cpio, gunzip, zcat, netstat and ping.

Command binaries that are deemed not essential enough to merit a place in the /bin directory go in /usr/bin. Programs required only by non-root users are placed in this category.

Some recent distributions have abandoned the strategy of separating /bin and /usr/bin (as well as /sbin and /usr/sbin) and just have one directory with symbolic links, thereby preserving a two directory view. They view the time-honored concept of enabling the possibility of placing /usr on a separate partition to be mounted after boot as obsolete.

Recent distribution versions of RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu have symbolically linked /bin and /usr/bin so they are actually the same.
