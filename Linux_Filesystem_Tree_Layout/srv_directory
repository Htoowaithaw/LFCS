According to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):

"/srv contains site-specific data which is served by this system.

This main purpose of specifying this is so that users may find the location of the data files for particular service, and so that services which require a single tree for readonly data, writable data and scripts (such as cgi scripts) can be reasonably placed.

The methodology used to name subdirectories of /srv is unspecified as there is currently no consensus on how this should be done. One method for structuring data under /srv is by protocol, e.g. ftp, rsync, www, and cvs."

Some system administrators (and distributions) swear by the use of the /srv directory; others ignore it. There is often confusion about what is best to go in /var, as opposed to /srv.

On Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Red Hat-based ones, /srv is empty by default.
