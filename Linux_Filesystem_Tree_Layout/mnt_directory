This directory is provided so that the system administrator can temporarily mount a filesystem when needed. A common use is for network filesystems, including:

NFS
Samba
CIFS
AFS.
Historically, /mnt was also used for the kinds of files which are now mounted under /media (or /run/media) in modern systems.

Generally speaking, this directory should not be used by installation programs. Another temporary directory not currently being used serves better.

Command:

$ sudo mount c8:/ISO_IMAGES /mnt
