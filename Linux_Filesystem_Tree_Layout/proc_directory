This directory is the mount point for a pseudo-filesystem, where all information resides only in memory, not on disk. Like /dev, the /proc directory is empty on a non-running system.

The kernel exposes some important data structures through /proc entries. Additionally, each active process on the system has its own subdirectory that gives detailed information about the state of the process, the resources it is using, and its history.

The entries in /proc are often termed virtual files and have interesting qualities. While most are listed as zero bytes in size, when viewed, they can contain a large amount of information.

In addition, most of the time and date settings on virtual files reflect the current time and date, indicative of the fact they are constantly changing. In fact, the information in these files is obtained only when they are viewed; they are not being constantly or periodically updated.

Important pseudo-files, including /proc/interrupts, /proc/meminfo, /proc/mounts, and /proc/partitions, provide an up-to-the-moment glimpse of the system's hardware.

Others, like /proc/filesystems and the /proc/sys/ directory, provide system configuration information and interfaces.

For organizational purposes, files containing information on a similar topic are grouped into virtual directories and sub-directories. For instance, /proc/scsi/ contains information for all physical SCSI devices. Likewise, the process directories contain information about each running process on the system.

We will examine entries in /proc throughout this course, and we will take a more detailed look at them in upcoming chapters about kernel configuration and system monitoring.
