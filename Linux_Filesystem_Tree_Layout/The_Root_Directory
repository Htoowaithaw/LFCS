While the entire filesystem can be viewed as one big tree, as we have pointed out, there may be multiple partitions and filesystems joined together.

The partition and filesystem that the root directory itself is contained in is rather special and is often in a special dedicated partition, with other components with directories such as /home, /var and /opt, etc., to be mounted later.

The root partition must contain all essential files required to boot the system and then mount all other filesystems. Thus, it needs utilities, configuration files, boot loader information, and other essential startup data. It must be adequate to:

Boot the system.​
Restore the system from system backups on external media such as tapes and other removable media or NAS etc.​
Recover and/or repair the system; an experienced maintainer must have the tools to diagnose and reconstruct a damaged system.
According to the FHS, no application or package should create new subdirectories of the root directory.

Important: / is not /root.
We are not talking about /root, which is the home directory of root, the superuser. The word choices here can be confusing!
