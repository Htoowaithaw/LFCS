On Linux systems, user directories are conventionally placed under /home, as in /home/coop, /home/student, etc. All personal configuration, data, and executable programs are placed in this directory hierarchy. /home may also contain subdirectories for various groups or various associations of users, such as /home/students, /home/staff, /home/aliens, etc.

On other UNIX-like operating systems, the concept of the /home directory tree exists, but can be subtly different. For example, on Solaris, user directories are created in /export/home and then, the automount facility will eventually mount them in /home. This is because the usual situation is that the home directory may be anywhere on a corporate network, probably on an NFS server, and the home directory will be mounted automatically upon use.

Linux has these same automount facilities, but many users are not even aware of them, and, on self-contained systems, the concept of NFS mounts will probably not apply.

A given user can always substitute the environmental variable $HOME for their root directory, or the shorthand ~; i.e., the following commands are equivalent:

$ ls -l $HOME/public_html

$ ls -l ~/public_html

There is one exception: the home directory for the root user on Linux systems is always found under /root. Some older UNIX systems may use / instead, which can cause clutter.

Depending on how many times you have upgraded your system or copied your home directory around, there can be a great variety of files:

Media and data in XDG specified directories such as ˜/Documents, ˜/Downloads, ˜/Pictures, and ˜/Desktop
Program user data in dotfiles or in the newer locations like ˜/.config and ˜/.local
Even log files such as ˜/.xsession-errors
