This directory contains binaries essential for booting, restoring, recovering, and/or repairing in addition to those binaries in the /bin directory. They also must be able to mount other filesystems on /usr, /home and other locations if needed, once the root filesystem is known to be in good health during boot.

The following programs should be included in this directory (if their subsystems are installed):

fdisk, fsck, getty, halt, ifconfig, init, mkfs, mkswap, reboot, route, swapon, swapoff, update.

Command:

$ ls -l /sbin

Output:

rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Apr 23 08:23 /sbin -> usr/sbin
