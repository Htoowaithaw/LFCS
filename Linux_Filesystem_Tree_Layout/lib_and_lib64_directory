These directories should contain only those libraries needed to execute the binaries in /bin and /sbin. These libraries are particularly important for booting the system and executing commands within the root filesystem.

Kernel modules (often device or filesystem drivers) are located under /lib/modules/<kernel-version-number>, as in /lib/modules/5.19.4.

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) files are stored in distribution-dependent locations such as /lib64/security or /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security.

Systems which support both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries need to keep both kinds of libraries on the system. On some distributions, there are separate directories for 32-bit libraries (/lib) and 64-bit libraries (/lib64).

Command:

$ ls -l /lib* 

Output:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Apr 23 2020 /lib -> usr/lib
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Apr 23 2020 /lib64 -> usr/lib64
