Recalling, Editing Previous Commands
With the arrow keys, you are essentially moving up and down your history list - most recently executed command first. !! (often pronounced as “bang-bang”) executes the previous command.

CTRL-R is used to search through history. Hitting CTRL-R multiple times allows you to scan backwards through previous commands. Here is an example of CTRL-R:

# This all happens on 1 line
$ CTRL-R git
(reverse-i-search)`git': git rm -f exported-variables.inc
# Type Enter to execute or hit again:
$ CTRL-R
(reverse-i-search)`git': git ls-files
# Type Enter to execute
