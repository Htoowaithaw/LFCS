All history substitutions start with !.

To start a history substitution: !
To refer to the last argument in a line: !$
To refer to the n-th command line: !n
To refer to the most recent command starting with !string
Thus, in the following command:

$ ls -l /bin /etc /var

!$ refers to /var which is the last argument in the line above.

You can see a few examples below:

$ history
1 echo $SHELL
2 echo $HOME
3 echo $PS1
4 ls-a
5 ls -l /etc/passwd
6 sleep 1000
7 history

$ !1    # Execute command #1 above
echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

$ !sl   # Execute command beginning with "sl"
sleep 1000
