Without the startup (initialization) file processing, each time a command or program is run there may be a lot of setup work to ensure proper functioning.

Many programs evaluate certain environment variables are set when they begin to execute, and then make use of them to control functioning.

For example, any program which needs to modify text files interactively will see how EDITOR is set, perhaps to vim, emacs, or nano (whichever editor the user prefers to use).

To summarize, some of the advantages of using startup files are:

Customizing the user's prompt
Setting the user's terminal type
Setting command line shortcuts and aliases
Setting the default text editor
Etc.
We will see examples of the above in the section on environment variables.
