One often needs to login through the network into a remote system, or carry out commands on a remote system, either with the same username or another. Or one needs to transfer files to and from a remote machine (using scp). In either case, one wants to do this securely, free from interception.

SSH (Secure SHell) exists for this purpose. It uses encryption based on strong algorithms. Assuming the proper ssh packages are installed on a system, one needs no further setup to begin using ssh. To sign onto a remote system, you can use the following command:

$ ssh farflung.com

student@farflung.com's password: (type here)

assuming there is a student account on farflung.com. To log in as a different user, you can use:

$ ssh root@farflung.com
$ ssh -l root farflung.com

To copy files from one system to another, you can do the following:

$ scp file.txt farflung.com:/tmp
$ scp file.tex student@farflung.com/home/student
$ scp -r some_dir farflung.com:/tmp/some_dir

We have omitted the request for a password to save space.

To run a command on multiple systems simultaneously, you can use the following command:

$ for machines in node1 node2 node3
  do
      (ssh $machines some_command &)
done

You can use the pssh (Parallel SSH) utility to execute a command on multiple systems in one fell stroke as in:

$ pssh -viH machine1 machine2 machine3 do_something

You may need to read the man page for pssh to figure out all its options and how to deal with passwords.
