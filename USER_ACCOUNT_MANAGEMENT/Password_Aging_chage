It is generally considered important to change passwords periodically. This limits the amount of time a cracked password can be useful to an intruder and also can be used to lock unused accounts. The downside is users can find this policy annoying and wind up writing down their ever-changing passwords and thus making them easier to steal. The utility that manages this is chage:

chage [-m mindays] [-M maxdays] [-d lastday] [-I inactive] [-E expiredate] [-W warndays] user

Only the root user can use chage. The one exception to this is that any user can run with the -l option to determine when their password or account is due to expire.

To force a user to change their password at their next login, you can run the following command:

$ sudo chage -d 0 USERNAME

Examples of chage:

$ sudo chage -l beaver

$ sudo chage -m 14 -M 30 wally

$ sudo chage -E 2012-4-1 eddie

$ sudo chage -d 0 june
