When you login to Linux, /etc/profile is always read and evaluated. Next, the following files are searched for in this order:

~/.bash_profile - login shells configuration
~/.bash_login - login initialization
~/.profile - overrides /etc/profile
After finding the first file it comes to, the Linux login shell will evaluate that one startup file and ignore all the rest.

While this may sound redundant, various Linux distributions tend to use different startup files.

Every time you create a sub-shell, but aren’t logging in, only ~/.bashrc is read and evaluated. While it is not read and evaluated with a login shell, most distributions and users will call ~/.bashrc from within one of the three user-owned startup files; so, in reality, ~/.bashrc is used for login shells.

Thus the vast majority of your customizations should go into ~/.bashrc.
