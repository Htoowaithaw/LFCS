The convention most Linux distributions have used is that any account with a UID less than 1000 is considered special and belongs to the system; normal user accounts start at 1000. The actual value is defined as UID_MIN and is defined in /etc/login.defs.

Historically, Red Hat-derived distributions used UID_MIN=500, not 1000, but beginning with RHEL 7, the more common value of 1000 was adopted.

If a UID is not specified when using useradd, the system will incrementally assign use IDs starting at UID_MIN.

Additionally, each user gets a Primary Group ID which by default is the same number as the UID. These are sometimes called User Private Groups (UPG).

/etc/passwd file contains one record (one line) for each user, each of which is a colon ( : ) separated list of fields:

username: user’s unique name
password: either the hashed password (if /etc/shadow is not used) or a place holder (”x” when /etc/shadow is used)
UID: user identification number
GID: primary group identification number for the user
comment: comment area, usually the user’s real name
home: directory pathname for the user’s home directory
shell: absolutely qualified name of the shell to invoke at login
It is bad practice to edit /etc/passwd, /etc/group or /etc/shadow directly; use appropriate utilities such as usermod, or for advanced users - the slightly safer tools vipw/vigr.
