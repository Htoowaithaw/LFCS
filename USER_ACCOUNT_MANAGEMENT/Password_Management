Passwords can be changed with passwd.

Users can change their own password. Root can change any user password.

By default, the password choice is examined by pam_cracklib.so, which furthers making good password choices. A normal user changing their password would type the following command:

$ passwd

Output:

Changing password for bjmoose
(current) UNIX password: <bjmoose's password>
New UNIX password: <bjmoose's-new-password>
Retype new UNIX password: <bjmoose's-new-password>
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully

Note that when root changes a user’s password, root is not prompted for the current password.

Command:

$ sudo passwd rjsquirrel

Output:

New UNIX password: <rjsquirrel's-new-password>
Retype new UNIX password: <rjsquirrel's-password>
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully

Note that normal users will not be allowed to set bad passwords, such as ones that are too short, or based on dictionary words. However, root is allowed to do so.
