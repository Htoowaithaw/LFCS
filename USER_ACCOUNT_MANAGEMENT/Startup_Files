Every time a new shell (either a command window or a script that is run) begins executing, there are files included that contain elements employed to ensure proper functioning. This may include:

Defining relevant environment variables that are used by many programs and scripts (including $PATH)
Defining aliases that are used as shorthand to specify commands and options
Defining functions that can be used in subsequent scripts
There are usually system-wide global initializing files found in /etc that are used by all users before individualized files are used.

The files in the user home directory override global settings.

Exactly which files are used and in what order depends on the context as we will explain.
